# Airbnb Machine Learning Project

Welcome to my **Airbnb Machine Learning Project** repository! This project demonstrates various machine learning techniques and models applied to real-world Airbnb data. The goal is to explore, prepare, and model the data to extract meaningful insights and make accurate predictions.

## Project Structure

This repository contains several Python notebooks, each focusing on different stages of the machine learning lifecycle, from data understanding to model evaluation. Below is a summary of the key notebooks and their contents:

### 1. **Lab 1: ML Life Cycle - Business Understanding and Problem Formulation**
   This notebook introduces the project, defines the business problem, and formulates the machine learning objectives for Airbnb data.  
   - **Focus**: Problem formulation, business context

### 2. **Lab 2: ML Life Cycle - Data Understanding and Preparation**
   In this notebook, I explore the dataset, assess data quality, handle missing values, and prepare the data for modeling.  
   - **Focus**: Data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering

### 3. **Lab 3: ML Life Cycle - Modeling (KNN and Decision Trees)**
   This notebook compares two popular classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees.  
   - **Focus**: Training and comparing classification models

### 4. **Lab 4: ML Life Cycle - Logistic Regression from Scratch**
   In this notebook, I build a logistic regression model from scratch without using libraries to understand the underlying mechanics.  
   - **Focus**: Logistic regression implementation, theory

### 5. **Lab 5: ML Life Cycle - Model Evaluation and Deployment**
   Here, I evaluate the performance of the models, comparing them on various metrics, and discuss considerations for deployment.  
   - **Focus**: Model evaluation, performance metrics

### 6. **Lab 6: Training and Comparing Regression Models**
   This notebook focuses on training and comparing multiple regression models to predict numerical values in the Airbnb dataset.  
   - **Focus**: Regression models, comparison of performances

### 7. **Lab 7: Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network Using Keras**
   This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras for advanced modeling on Airbnb data.  
   - **Focus**: Neural networks, deep learning with CNN

## Key Features of the Project
